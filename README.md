This repo contains a script meant to make it easier to install software on a new laptop. Ideally, though I haven't tried, I should just be able to `curl` this script from Github and run it with python3.

## Design
Because the script is meant to be `curl`'ed on a new laptop, there are a few restrictions on the design. First, it must all be in one file. If this proves too unwieldy, I might write a preprocessor in the future to concatenate multiple files together. Second, it cannot use any dependencies except for modules provided in the standard library.

The overall design of this script is inspired by [Prodspec and Annealing](https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/prodspec-and-annealing-intent-based-actuation-google-production), which itself is inspired by [Entity Component System] architectures in game designâ€”hence the somewhat odd naming in the script.
